# FPS Firing Modes

# What is this project?
This project aims to add different weapon firing modes natively to shooter games.

It currently has four modes:
- Off (off, indicated by long low beep)
- Burst fire (fire x amount of bullets in a row, indicated by one beep)
- Rapid fire (fire anything as fast as possible, indicated by two beeps)
- Single shot (makes automatic guns shoot single shots, indicated by three beeps)

# Installation
1. Download and install AutoHotKey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download FPS_Firing_Modes.ahk and double click it to run.

# How to use
1. Run FPS_Firing_Modes.ahk
2. Start any game you like.
3. Press the first button on the side of your mouse (or F6 if you don't have one)
4. You should here a beep indicating the mode switch (one beep is Burst fire, two beeps is Rapid Fire, three beeps is Single Shot, and one long beep is Off)

# Why would I want to use this?
There are a variety of reasons why you could use this script.
- The game you are trying to play does not support different weapon firing modes.
- You would like to adjust the handling to your preferences

# How does it work?
This script simulates mouse clicks to fire bullets in a certain pattern or speed. For example:
- Weapons that are considered semi-automatic (read: Can shoot as fast a your finger can hit the mouse button) can become fully automatic this way.
- Weapons that are automatic can be made semi-automatic by enabling single shot mode.
- Any automatic or semi-automatic weapon can be made to burst fire (e.g. three shots in a row)

# Compatibility
This script should work on any game but can be tweaked per game for better results. Ideally, I'd like to implement a way to configure presets for different games to improve compatibility.

# Online usage
Please carefully research whether a script like this is allowed to be used in the game you are trying to use it on. In online games, it can provide an unfair advantage to your opponents or may get you banned from the online service. I am not responsible for how you use the script, so please proceed with caution.
